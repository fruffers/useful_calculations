# Getting a row index of 1D array using integer division

Loop height i { 

​	i / width = current row

}



Examples:

0 / 6 = 0

1 / 6 = 0

2 / 6 = 0

6 / 6 = 1

7 / 6 = 1

12 / 6 = 2

# Getting column index in row with modulo

Loop height i {

​	i % width = current column index

}



Examples:

 0 % 6 = 0

1 % 6 = 2

2 % 6 = 3

3 % 6 = 4



Examples:

2 mod 6

1. Divide Dividend by Divisor 2 / 6 = 0.33

2. Take Whole part of Quotient and multiply by Divisor 0 * 6 = 0

3. Take answer and subtract from the Dividend 2 - 0 = 2

# Storing numbers in 1D array and getting the index value by giving the row and column

The index of the value at `(x, y)` in a 1D array is given by: index = y * width + x
